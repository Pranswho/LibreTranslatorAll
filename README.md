# LibreTranslatorGerman
Translate a PDF file from English to German, French, Spanish, Portuguese. 

A basic translator which uses tkinter to ask the user for a PDF document to be translated from English to 4 different languages.

Translation: The program first identifies the source language, it needs to translate the text into the target language. We've used the LibreTranslator API for this project. This APIs allow the program to translate the text from English to the desired target Language, and retrieve the translated text in a machine-readable format.

Formatting: Finally, the program needs to format the translated text into a document that is readable and easily understood by humans. This could involve formatting the text into paragraphs and adjusting the font size and style to make the document more visually appealing. This step could be accomplished using a document formatting library such as PyPDF2 and FPDF.
